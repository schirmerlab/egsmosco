### Figure 2 - Spinal cord GS expression is macroglial-specific.
A) UMAP depicting 43,890 cells partitioned in seven cell type clusters. MG/MP, microglia/macrophage, AS, astrocytes; EC, endothelial cells, CHN, cholinergic neurons; IN, inhibitory neurons; EN, excitatory neurons. 

B) Average expression of Glul and cell-type specific markers Mobp (OL), Aqp4 (AS), Flt1 (EC), Cx3cr1 (MG) and Rfbox3 (all neurons).
